I have used MySQL Workbench to attain some insights which can help customers chose a healthy diet plan. It can also help nutritionist suggest healthy Indian diet according to the body type or requirement of the patient....

By doing this analysis I am able to achieve insights about-
1) Veg and non-veg Indian food items that are rich in protein
2) Protein rich food and their sugar content
3) High sugar content food items
4) Food items rich in Vitamin-D
5) High fiber content food
6) Food with a balanced amount of carbohydrate,protein and fat.
